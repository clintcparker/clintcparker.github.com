Fostering the Team
First of all, most teams are already great, they may just know or show it. The talent is usually already in the building. I'm confident in the abilities and potential of most developers and testers to succeed with any project we throw at them. 

But, all organizations can do better. We can do better as an leaders by setting an example. And we can set an example in 3 key ways: Transparency, Respect, and Accountability.

Let’s look at  transparency first.

Transparency
One thing I am not confident in most teams to do, is communicate the company vision. I think very few of developers could tell you how what they're _currently_ working on lines up with company goals, or what priority it is.

We can start to change this with transparency, which happens to also be a core tenet of Scrum. By being transparent, as leaders, as an organization, we can empower our product development teams to make good, informed decisions about their projects. And we can show them the visible importance of their work on our backlog.

In setting this example, we can expect the same from them. It is as simple as professional courtesy. We can show our steps in decision making, and they can show theirs. The same goes for progress. This expected transparency will increase mutual understanding between product development and all other departments and department heads.

By increasing this communication and buy-in, we will provide our teams with intrinsic motivation. We will all be purpose-driven, and we will see better results in quality and productivity.

Respect
Respect may be the hardest thing to foster in our product development team. From my perspective, mutual respect between all members of our team is missing in many of the relationships. Sometimes it is simply person to person, but other times it is person to department. A lot of the time it is person to organization. And again, we can fix this by setting an example. We can lean on our teams harder than we have to date. We can expect great things, and we can communicate our expectations. And not just verbally. We really need to trust our teams to solve problems, and not to simply follow instructions.

I often see team members hesitating to make suggestions or question the projects goals. This is a bad thing. We should be fostering these conversations, because these conversations lead to innovation and creative solutions. Let's encourage questions, and expect great solutions from our development teams.

Accountability
With our freshly conveyed respect, we gain accountability. 

Most notions of accountability come from negative perspectives. We only need to foster accountability because we need someone to be accountable for something that has gone wrong. It's true, and from time to time we need in our organizations. It's also a key part of coaching. And sometimes, it's a good motivator to know that if a project fails, some person or group can be held accountable. 

The concept I think everyone misses with accountability, though, is that it's a two way street. Early in my career, I worked on a team for 18 months before I knew about my accountability for someone's _positive_ experience with our software. That’s right, for a year and a half, the only post-release feedback I received for my code was the negative type. Obviously the company appreciated my work, but all I really ever saw were the bugs.

The feedback loop needs to continue regardless of the feedback. 

We all go to many post-mortems when something our team worked on broke. We rarely go to a meeting to explain why or how something our team worked on was produced so well. As engineering leaders, we need to be asking a lot more questions of the successful teams than the unsuccessful ones. We should maximize our success instead of minimizing our failure. 

Attracting Top Talent
I have to admit, this is my weakest area. But it is also one that I am extremely passionate about. 

Having confidence in our retention strategies is a good start for attracting talent, but the attraction needs to go a step further.

With a re-thought and stronger API, MINDBODY-hosted hackathons would make a lot of sense for recruiting. It would be wonderful to find talented developers that are already familiar with our concepts. But I think we’re 7-8 months away from that. Simply promoting ourselves as a world class shop seems more feasible. 

I think a MINDBODY Developer’s Blog could be a good way to showcase all the change that’s on our horizon. A peek into how we are building great software, and the processes and tools we use. Publicly displaying that we are using the latest technology and techniques certainly wouldn’t hurt us. 


Employee Retention
Let’s keep the talent we’ve attracted. Let’s also keep the talent we nurtured. Both are big investments. 

We need to keep our employees not unhappy. The double negative is to enforce that the biggest payoff is in keeping them from looking elsewhere. I would like them to all be happy and evangelistic for our shop, but it is not nearly as cost effective.

This, unlike keeping employees happy, is not hard. And it is not always about money. We're definitely moving in the right direction, but we should be two steps ahead of our team in regards to making them professionally satisfied. We just need to listen better.

If "Sally the developer" keeps telling us about some awesome hardware she saw, or her friend has, or she wishes he had, we should probably tell her she can get new hardware. And she can pick it. Hardware, seats, keyboard, headphones, schedules, etc. Let them pick. If you’re concerned about cost, let them pick once every 2 years. Anything else won't keep them off the greener grass.

Let’s outwardly promote retention. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most employer-employee relationships are less than 2 years. Let’s celebrate 3. OR 4. We can openly promote stay bonuses for retained employees. We can also openly promote career paths at MINDBODY. We should offer desirable paths for both technical and non-technical leadership. Any members of the team should be able to look at our published career info and see a place for themselves in 3 or 5 or 10 years.

Coaching Up or Out
Coaching starts at the top.

360 reviews, standardized tests, and small scale management have long been used by our QA department, and are making their way to the rest of Product Development. These should be decreasing the length of the feedback loop to our team members. With more consistent interaction and better data, there should be no excuses for supervisors not detecting and addressing issues early on. 

As Director of Product Development, if I were to hear about someone having coachable problems, I would expect their supervisor to not only be aware, but also addressing it. Missing leadership has let small problems turn into big ones. We should not tolerate poor performances in any role, including leadership ones. 

In a more proactive approach, I have spearheaded the effort to create a Jr Developer position, with focus on candidates learning and becoming strong developers in their first year. With this position we have set up structured check-in points for these new developers, ensuring they reach our high expectations quickly. By putting this effort in early, we are setting a precedent for expected performance.

For our non-junior development candidates, we are more closely examining their skill-sets prior to hiring. We should position ourselves so we do not have to waste time on technical coaching for experienced team members.

We already have strong organizational buy-in for technical training, but I would promote it more than we have previously. This falls inline with our core value of continuous evolution, and addresses the current technical gap in our QA department.
