title: "Software Leadership - Attracting Top Talent"
---

This is an area that I am extremely passionate about. _Building_ great teams is very rewarding.

Attracting _top_ talent builds upon having confidence in our retention strategies. 

With a re-thought and stronger API, hosted-hackathons can make a lot of sense for local recruiting. It would be wonderful to find talented developers that are already familiar with our concepts. But I think we’re 7-8 months away from that. Simply promoting ourselves as a world class shop seems more feasible. 

A Developer’s Blog is a really good way to showcase all the change that’s on our horizon. A peek into how we are building great software, and the processes and tools we use. Publicly displaying that we are using the latest technology and techniques certainly wouldn’t hurt us.
