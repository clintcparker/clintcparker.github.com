title: "Remote Teams"
---

Remote teams are here to stay. I see the headlines about RTO, but I can't honestly believe that many or even _any_ of those efforts will work out. Maybe I'm naive. Maybe it was never about team productivity but simply control. Like the original trickery of the office perks, ping-pong tables, unlimited snacks, dry-cleaning; none were actually meant to make an employee happier, they were meant to keep the employee in the office longer. 

And I'm saying this as a person that loved to be in the office. I enjoyed every perk. I was in early and stayed late. I was both extremely productive and extremely unproductive in the office. Coming in early and staying late allows for 2 hour lunches. Expectations of the office being _the_ place led to mimosa and waffle parties, bagel mondays, thursday and friday afternoon parties (and party-planning).

I'm saying all of this as a person who loved all of that non-work, all of that camaraderie and "team-building."
