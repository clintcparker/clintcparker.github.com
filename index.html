      <h2 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/2023/11/08/what-even-is-innovation/">What Even Is Innovation?</a></h2>

      <time datetime="2023-11-08T10:05:08-08:00" class="post-date">November 08, 2023</time>

      <p>I was once asked about the most inventive or innovative thing I’d done. Where to start? I’m a middling engineer at best. I fully subscribe to my own pitch as a leader that engineers should prioritize simplicity and obviousness over performance and cleverness.</p>

<p>That said, I have an obvious answer to “What is the most interesting problem you ever solved?” And just to be transparent and fair, I didn’t solve this in a vacuum. I worked with a great team and would not have succeeded without their help.</p>

<p>The innovation I’m proud of is a little embarrassing due to the underlying technology. While I was at Mindbody, we uncovered an impactful limitation of scaling Classic ASP web applications. That’s right, Mindbody was still very much reliant on Classic ASP, which had been deprecated with the arrival of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.NET</code>. The solution to this scaling problem wasn’t particularly complex, but the novelty and impact qualify as innovative. In the end, we were able to proactively identify, remediate, and prevent future consequences of the limitation.</p>

<p>In late 2017, our VP of Engineering asked me to investigate an issue plaguing another team in his org. I was a Senior Manager overseeing other teams in technically a different department, but I and some of my group had historical experience in the code in question. The nominal problem: a deployed bundle of changes resulted in a 10% increase in CPU usage in production. Rolling the deployment back brought the usage back down, and vice versa. Additionally, the CPU increase was not detectable outside of the production environment. ☹️</p>

<p>I started by enlisting one of the senior engineers on my team, and we began reviewing the changes in the associated deployment. Nothing initially jumped out at us, but on the 3rd pass, I began to suspect that the problem could be related to a change of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code> reference file. Please see my early post about conditional <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> references to understand why this is already a potential issue. (And begin to understand my absolute hat of the continued use of VBScript). – Side note: VBScript is awesome circa 1997. But, like everything else in the universe, we evolved, and the evolution of VBScript on the server was <code class="highlighter-rouge">.NET</code>. Now, if you want to complain about people <em>choosing</em> to use VBScript after 2001, I’d be happy to drink my sorrows away beside you. Rant over, for now– This reference file had <em>itself</em> added another reference, which is typical. But in this case, the outer file was almost ubiquitously referenced in every top-level file. Specifically, the heavy usage of the modified file meant that this small change was probably causing a wider-than-obvious impact.</p>

<p>To test the hypothesis that this one-line change was the culprit, we removed that commit from the bundle and redeployed it without issue. The CPU usage increase disappeared! While the immediate problem was solved, I still wanted to know the root cause and prevention methods.</p>

<p>I then endeavored to prove this issue was detectable via static code analysis. My second hypothesis was that this was related to the server doing more work interpreting more lines per request. The structure of Classic ASP requires that every single line be interpreted when served. Therefore, I suspected that more lines interpreted meant more work being done per request and, in turn, higher CPU usage.</p>

<p>We created a NodeJS command line tool to analyze the codebase to represent this. We used NodeJS because it truly is the best way to share multi-platform CLIs. And thank you, <a href="https://github.com/tj">TJ</a>, for <code class="highlighter-rouge">commander.js</code>! The references in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">include</code> files created an easily traversed tree. The tree was then flattened and converted to a total number of interpreted lines for any given top-level file.</p>

<p>We enhanced the tool to provide additional insights, such as the theoretical minimum total lines (fully optimized but impractical to maintain) and the specific references to any included file, as well as a bloat factor, which represented how far the structure of a file was from the optimal. The results were output as one CSV file and a collection of JSON files.</p>

<p>The results were astounding! The original (problematic) one-line change increased the total number of interpreted lines from 26 million to 52 million. On the other side of the spectrum, the theoretical optimal number of lines was just over 12 million.</p>

<p>From the insights gleaned from the analysis, we could then restructure the file references to a more optimal state. Finally, we submitted pull requests to the owning team and reduced the total interpreted lines to 19 million.</p>

<p>Lastly, I saw that this specific issue could be prevented with these new insights. So, we created a step in the build process to run the analysis and limit the total interpreted lines not to exceed a variable maximum value.</p>

<p>Over the years, other engineers extended the tool to support visualizations of the reference tree and various library upgrades and bug fixes. It was still a critical build step at the time of my departure.</p>

<p>While none of the technology is particularly glamorous, I am proud of this innovation. Over a few weeks, existing concepts and platforms were reorganized to create something novel and beneficial. We didn’t patent anything. We didn’t write a new language. Heck, we couldn’t even really talk about it for two main reasons: 1. The org didn’t want to admit to using outdated technology, 2. Who else was using that tech and would be interested in listening?</p>

<p>So, as I said at the beginning, I subscribe to my own pitch of simplicity. We used basic tools and concepts and put them together in a new way.</p>

<p>P.S. I’m not sure how much we saved the company, but it has to be substantial. At least 10 teams were blocked for 3 weeks from deploying to production. I think they would’ve continued to run into this issue, even if they found it in this instance, and probably would’ve resorted to massively overscaling production infrastructure. Yikes!</p>

<p>P.P.S. Let’s take a minute to discuss what was probably happening here. I say probably because I don’t know for sure the absolute underlying issue, and even if I did, there really isn’t any fixing it for this ecosystem.</p>

<p>VBScript works by retrieving the requested page/resource (<code class="highlighter-rouge">something.asp</code>) and then processing the contents based on the context/request and rendering the output. Again, top-notch for 1997.</p>

<p>VBScript is a v1 product. It isn’t optimized beyond what the engineers fathomed at the time of writing. So, VBScript pulls the initial ASP file from disk and processes it line-by-line. If there is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code>, it retrieves that and also processes it line-by-line. Why does it process every line? Because it’s a scripting language at heart, and those lines can modify global state outside of a method body( again, see my post on VBScript conditional includes). So, it is doing a lot of work for each page request. The engineers knew about this, so they created a cache of page contents to not have to go to disk every time.</p>

<p>In our case, though, these two concept collide and clobber each other. The need to process each request creates a ton of work, and the page sizes themselves become massive due to the (substantial but not infinite) recursive nature of the pages. Doing more work, and the cache can’t keep up, so it’s doing more work in vain. Brutal.</p>

<p>In the end, they did improve Classic ASP/VBScript … they created <code class="highlighter-rouge">.NET</code>.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/2022/05/25/when-to-micro-service/">When to Microservice</a></h2>

      <time datetime="2022-05-25T14:52:58-07:00" class="post-date">May 25, 2022</time>

      <p>I’m enjoying Microsoft Build 2022. Developer experience (especially in the face of common and complicated IaaS and PaaS scenarios) was my favorite topic of the day 1 keynotes.</p>

<p>Later, watching the keynote after hours, I stumbled on a gem of a conversation between Scott Hanselman and Scott Guthrie.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great informal discussion/perspective on when to use micro-services &amp; containers from <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shanselman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/scottgu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@scottgu</a> at 33:18.<a href="https://t.co/1tNahY1VSk">https://t.co/1tNahY1VSk</a></p>&mdash; Clint Parker (@clintcparker) <a href="https://twitter.com/clintcparker/status/1529577253423566848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Lot’s of classic “it depends” which is totally true. For me it depends on at least one of three macro factors being present:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Teams/people need to develop and deploy at different paces.</li>
  <li>Parts of the system <em>need</em> to scale independently</li>
  <li>Parts of the system <em>need</em> to be segmented for security purposes. Ex: only engineers from the payments team can make changes to payments systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can have any decomposition you like, but in that video Scott Guthrie alludes to the challenges you can face on either end of the spectrum (1 engineer with 100 micro-services or 100 engineers with one service).</p>

<p>One last note, I may start saying containers instead of micro-services going forward. I usually try say that I prefer macro-services, but then we have to have a whole discussion about the difference. Maybe the term container will become the defacto descriptor of services and their boundaries.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a class="post-link" href="/2022/04/13/software-leadership-fostering-the-team/">Software Leadership - Fostering the Team</a></h2>

      <time datetime="2022-04-13T13:11:39-07:00" class="post-date">April 13, 2022</time>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve been meaning to write my thoughts on software leadership for a while. I’ll try to do tht here with a series of posts on the topic. Let’s start with <strong>fostering a strong team</strong>.</p>

<p>First of all, most teams are already great, they may just not know or show it. The talent is usually already in the building. I’m confident in the abilities and potential of most engineering team members to succeed with any project we throw at them.</p>

<p>But all teams can do better. We can do better as organizations leaders by setting a good example. And we can start by setting an example in 3 key ways: <strong>Transparency</strong>, <strong>Respect</strong>, and <strong>Accountability</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
<p>One thing I am not confident in most teams to do, is communicate the company vision. I think very few of developers could tell you how what they’re <em>currently</em> working on lines up with company goals, or what priority it is.</p>

<p>We can start to change this with transparency, which happens to also be a core tenet of Scrum. By being transparent, as leaders, as an organization, we can empower our product development teams to make good, informed decisions about their projects. And we can show them the visible importance of their work on our backlog.</p>

<p>In setting this example, we can expect the same from them. It is as simple as professional courtesy. We can show our steps in decision making, and they can show theirs. The same goes for progress. This expected transparency will increase mutual understanding between product development and all other departments and department heads.</p>

<p>By increasing this communication and buy-in, we will provide our teams with intrinsic motivation. We will all be purpose-driven, and we will see better results in quality and productivity.</p>

<h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>
<p>Respect may be the hardest thing to foster in our product development team. From my perspective, mutual respect between all members of a team is often missing in many of the relationships. Sometimes it is simply person to person, but other times it is person to department. A lot of the time it is person to organization. And again, we can fix this by setting an example. We can lean on our teams harder than we have to date. We can expect great things, and we can communicate our expectations. And not just verbally. We really need to trust our teams to solve problems, and not to simply follow instructions.</p>

<p>I often see team members hesitating to make suggestions or question the projects goals. This is a bad thing. We should be fostering these conversations, because these conversations lead to innovation and creative solutions. Let’s encourage questions, and expect great solutions from our development teams.</p>

<h2 id="accountability">Accountability</h2>
<p>With our freshly conveyed respect, we gain accountability.</p>

<p>Most notions of accountability come from negative perspectives. We only need to foster accountability because we need someone to be accountable for something that has gone wrong. It’s true, and from time to time we need in our organizations. It’s also a key part of coaching. And sometimes, it’s a good motivator to know that if a project fails, some person or group can be held accountable.</p>

<p>The concept I think everyone misses with accountability, though, is that it’s a two way street. Early in my career, I worked on a team for 18 months before I knew about my accountability for someone’s <em>positive</em> experience with our software. That’s right, for a year and a half, the only post-release feedback I received for my code was the negative type. Obviously my team appreciated my work, but all I really ever saw beyond that were the bugs.</p>

<p>The feedback loop needs to continue regardless of the feedback.</p>

<p>We all go to many postmortems when something our team worked on broke. We rarely go to a meeting to explain why or how something our team worked on was produced so well. As engineering leaders, we need to be asking a lot more questions of the successful teams than the unsuccessful ones. We should maximize our success instead of minimizing our failure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s amusing how little software leadership has to do with the actual software sometimes. I promise I will have some more technical leadership topics in the future, but many will be like this. I hope some of this will help you with your teams. As always feel free to send any comments to me on Twitter at <em><a href="https://twitter.com/clintcparker">@clintcparker</a></em>.</p>

  <li>Remove the password from the newly created user</li>
  <li>Change default ports (ssh, RDP)</li>
  <li>Restrict RDP access to 127.0.0.1 only</li>
  <li>Create a host and client scripts to just take care of all of this</li>

      <time datetime="2018-09-21T16:22:49-07:00" class="post-date">September 21, 2018</time>

      <p><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/images/hub/netcore.svg" alt="dotnetcore" class="r-img" height="150px" />I recently created <a href="https://name-on.clintcparker.com">name-on</a> using the DotNetCore command line tools and VS Code. It was surprisingly easy, and I love scaffolding from the command line.</p>

<p><img src="https://fishshell.com/assets/img/Terminal_Logo_CRT_Small.png" alt="fish-shell" class="l-img" height="200px" />I also recently got my WSL setup working, which involved setting fish as my default shell, and revisiting some of the functions I have made in the past.</p>

<p>My quick experience with the DNC CLI seemed like the perfect thing to functionalize. I like having a standard structure to my apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>class library</li>
  <li>command line</li>
  <li>web app / API</li>
  <li>test project</li>
</ul>

<p>DNC has the concept of tmeplates and extensions, but what can I say, I wanted to write this with fish. So I did.</p>

<p>I picked the name belvedere by looking up scaffolding in a thesaurus. Apparently its a “raised turret atop a house,” and comes from 1590’s italian.</p>

<p>Belvedere will create all the necessary projects, with the correct intra-project references, a solution, gitignore, and README. It also intializes a git repo and commits the created files.</p>

<p>You can find the code here: <a href="https://github.com/clintcparker/fish_functions/blob/master/belvedere.fish">https://github.com/clintcparker/fish_functions/blob/master/belvedere.fish</a></p>
